      <p>
        I am currently an MBA candidate (class of 2016) at the Kellogg School of Management.

        As a management consultant for four years, I worked on a broad range of corporate issues such as growth strategy, organization design, pricing, supply chain and manufacturing efficiency improvement and large scale end-to-end cost reduction.

        I've applied this expertise to a diverse set of clients ranging from multi-national Fortune 500 companies to smaller entrepreneur-led firms in the high-tech, telecom, consumer goods and retail industries.

        My client engagements have also spanned diverse global locations including US, India, Australia, Middle East and South East Asia.
